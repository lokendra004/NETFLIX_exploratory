# 📺 Netflix Content Analysis with Python

This project presents a complete data analysis of a Netflix titles dataset using Python. The notebook (`netflix_analysis_python.ipynb`) performs data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to uncover insights about content types, genres, durations, and more.

---

## 🧾 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes metadata of Netflix content such as:
- `title`, `type` (Movie/Show), `release_year`, `runtime`
- `genres`, `production_countries`, `age_certification`
- Ratings from `IMDb` and `TMDb`

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

- Removed rows with missing titles
- Replaced `NULL` values in:
  - `description` → `'No Description'`
  - `age_certification` → `'Unrated'`
  - `imdb_id` → `'N/A'`
  - `production_countries = []` → `'Unknown'`
- Filled missing numeric columns (e.g., `imdb_score`) with their average
